## The Plot and the Characters of Lootera
 
Lootera begins in the year 1953, in the town of Manikpur in West Bengal. Pakhi Roy Chaudhary (Sonakshi Sinha) is the daughter of a zamindar (landlord) who loves to write stories and dreams of becoming a published author. One day, she meets Varun Shrivastav (Ranveer Singh), a young archaeologist who claims to be working on a project to excavate the temple grounds owned by her father. Varun and his friend Dev (Vikrant Massey) are invited to stay at Pakhi's mansion, where they gradually win the trust and affection of Pakhi and her father.
 
However, Varun is not who he pretends to be. He is actually a conman who works for a gang of robbers led by Jimmy (Arif Zakaria). His real name is Atmanand Tripathi, and he has been sent to Manikpur to loot the valuables hidden in the temple. Varun had planned to leave after completing his mission, but he falls in love with Pakhi and decides to stay with her. He even proposes to her and promises to marry her.
 
On the night before their wedding, Varun's true identity is exposed when Jimmy and his men raid the mansion and steal everything they can find. Varun tries to save Pakhi and her father from harm, but he is shot by Jimmy and falls into the river. Pakhi and her father are devastated by the betrayal and loss. Pakhi's father dies soon after from a heart attack, leaving Pakhi alone and heartbroken.
 
The film then shifts to the year 1956, in the town of Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh. Pakhi has moved to a secluded house in the hills, where she lives with her maid Kanta (Divya Dutta) and suffers from tuberculosis. She has given up on writing and life, and spends her days waiting for death. One day, she sees Varun outside her window, alive and well. She confronts him and learns that he had survived the gunshot wound and had been hiding from Jimmy and his gang ever since. He also tells her that he still loves her and wants to be with her.
 
Pakhi is torn between her love and hatred for Varun. She agrees to let him stay with her for a few days, but she also plans to take revenge on him by informing the police about his whereabouts. However, as they spend time together, they rekindle their romance and realize that they cannot live without each other. Pakhi decides to forgive Varun and run away with him.
 
Meanwhile, Jimmy has tracked down Varun's location and sends his men to kill him. Varun manages to fight them off, but he is wounded in the process. He reaches Pakhi's house, where he finds her packing their bags. He tells her that they have to leave immediately, but she refuses to go without finishing one last thing: writing a story for him.
 
Pakhi shows him a story that she has written based on their relationship. The story is titled "The Last Leaf", inspired by O. Henry's short story of the same name. In the story, a young woman named Pia suffers from a terminal illness and believes that she will die when the last leaf falls from the tree outside her window. Her lover Raju paints a leaf on the wall to make her believe that it is still there, thus giving her hope and saving her life.
 
Pakhi tells Varun that he is her last leaf, and that she wants him to read her story before they leave. Varun agrees and starts reading it aloud. As he reads, he notices that Pakhi has stopped breathing. He realizes that she has died peacefully in his arms.
 
The film ends with a shot of the tree outside Pakhi's window, where a single leaf remains attached to a branch.
